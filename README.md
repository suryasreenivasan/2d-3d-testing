# 2d-3d-testing 
*A 2D–3D Perspective Switching Concept built in Unity*

## 🧠 Project Overview
**PlaneShift** is an early-stage **game concept and technical prototype** developed in Unity.  
The project focuses exclusively on experimenting with a **2D to 3D plane-switching mechanic**.

At this stage, the project is **not a full game** — there are **no obstacles, enemies, or puzzles implemented yet**. The goal is to explore how switching between dimensions feels, looks, and functions at a core mechanical level.

## 🔄 Core Mechanic
- Seamless switching between **2D and 3D planes**
- Camera and player behavior adapts based on the active dimension
- Designed as a foundation for future puzzle or platforming mechanics

## 🕹️ Current Features
✅ 2D ↔ 3D plane switching  
✅ Player movement in both dimensions  
✅ Camera transitions between perspectives  

## ❌ Not Yet Implemented
- Obstacles or level challenges  
- Enemies
- Puzzle logic  
- Level progression  
- UI / Menus  

## 🖼️ Gameplay Concept
- **2D Mode:** Traditional side-scrolling movement
- **3D Mode:** Expanded movement across depth
- Switching dimensions is instant and intended to be used as a core traversal tool in future development

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Unity**
- **C#**
- Unity Input System
